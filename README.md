# Refactor-X

## User Story

AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines


## Acceptance Criteria

The website must meet accessibility standards. This was achieved by completing the following:

* Semantic HTML elements introduced throughout the source code
* HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
* Image and icon elements contain accessible `alt` attributes
* Heading attributes fall in sequential order
* Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title

## Additional code re-factor
The CSS file was re-factored to clean up repetition where element stylings could be grouped.
