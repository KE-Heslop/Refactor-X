# Refactor-X

## User Story

AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines


## Acceptance Criteria

The website must meet accessibility standards. This was achieved by completing the following:

* Semantic HTML elements introduced throughout the source code
* HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
* Image and icon elements contain accessible `alt` attributes
* Heading attributes fall in sequential order
* Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title
<img width="468" alt="Horiseon" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121969930/221303426-a21ce443-2998-4dcb-9f1c-c64af82d3a09.png">

## Additional code re-factor
The CSS file was re-factored to clean up repetition where element stylings could be grouped.
